### Rubric for Evaluating JS Functions Challenge

Each section is scored from **1 to 5**, with **5 being the highest**. Use this rubric to evaluate how well each requirement is met.

---

### **Exercise Completion (1-5)** ‚Üí üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **25%**

Evaluate if the functions meet the defined requirements in each case.

| **Score** | **Criteria**                                                                              |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1**     | No code written or incorrect implementation that does not meet the exercise requirements. |
| **2**     | Bare minimum attempt, but incorrect or incomplete solution for most exercises.            |
| **3**     | Some exercises are completed correctly, but others are incorrect or incomplete.           |
| **4**     | Most exercises are completed correctly, but there are small issues in some tasks.         |
| **5**     | All exercises are implemented correctly, meeting the expected functionality.              |

### **Code Quality (1-5)** ‚Üí üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **50%**

Evaluate if the code adheres to the presented best practices (correct function naming, proper formatting, application of presented calisthenics, correct definition of function returns).

| **Score** | **Criteria**                                                                                          |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1**     | Code is poorly organized, difficult to follow.                                                        |
| **2**     | Code is somewhat organized but has several issues (e.g., inconsistent indentation, wrong naming,...). |
| **3**     | Code is functional but could use improvements in clarity and structure.                               |
| **4**     | Code is clean and readable, with proper indentation, variable naming,...                              |
| **5**     | Code is well-organized, easy to follow, following best clean code practises.                          |

### **Function Signature Definition (1-5)** ‚Üí üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **20%**

Evaluate if the functions are documented using JSDocs, all input and output elements are correctly defined, expected data types are used, and descriptions are clear, understandable, and accessible through the editor's lint.

| **Score** | **Criteria**                                                                                              |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1**     | No JSDocs provided, or documentation is incorrect or incomplete.                                          |
| **2**     | JSDocs are present but lack clarity or completeness in defining inputs and outputs.                       |
| **3**     | JSDocs are mostly complete but may have minor issues in clarity or data type definitions.                 |
| **4**     | JSDocs are clear and mostly complete, with correct data types and understandable descriptions.            |
| **5**     | JSDocs are thorough, with clear and complete definitions of inputs and outputs, using correct data types. |

### **Version Control & CI/CD Workflow (1-5)** ‚Üí üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **5%**

Evaluate adherence to version control and branching strategy practices, as well as CI/CD setup.

| **Score** | **Criteria**                                                                                                                             |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1**     | No repository created, improper or missing branch usage, no commits or PR created.                                                       |
| **2**     | Repository exists, but branching or commits are poorly managed (e.g., no `develop` branch, improper commit messages).                    |
| **3**     | Basic version control practices followed, but with minor issues (e.g., missing conventional commits or CI/CD setup).                     |
| **4**     | Good version control practices, with proper branch usage and meaningful commit messages.                                                 |
| **5**     | Excellent version control with proper branching, conventional commits, pull request creation, and clear adherence to the CI/CD workflow. |
